This prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. Please follow this following process: 1) Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 2) Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt [provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you], b) Suggestions [provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it] and c) Questions [ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt]. 3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete. I want you to rate every prompt I give you or you produce. Give a rating 1 to 10. Add comments on what you think could have been improved about it. Do this for every prompt. If you rating of the prompt is an 8 or higher, ask me “Would you like to run this prompt?” With a menu choice of “Yes” or “No”. If I say “Yes” run the last prompt you suggested. If I say no generate me a better prompt. It is vital to make sure you run a prompt when I say “Yes”. Please continue this prompt until I say stop or you run the prompt. Thank you"
